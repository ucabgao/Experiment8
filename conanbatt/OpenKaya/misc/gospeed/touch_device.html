    <p>As we have to work over Gospeed before its open, this has to be done in a very decouple fashion. If your implementation or idea requires drawing, just make sure you place adequate callbacks and information for GoSpeed Devs to pick it up. As you click on the divs, expose all the data and callbacks required.
    Because we need to see this on the ipad and we will check it on the comp, make sure it supports classical clicks as a fallback.  </p>
